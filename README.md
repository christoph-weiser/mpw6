# Layout

The layout was created using [magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic) 
with the [open_pdk](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks) sky130 setup as a pcell generator
and [klayout](https://www.klayout.de/) for the layout and assembly of the gds.

### Architecture

The Architecture of SAR is shown below. It is a differential
architecture with a top-plate sampled CDAC.

![SAR-Architecture](docs/pictures/sar_arch.png "SAR-Architecture")


## Comparator

The comparator is pretty standard single stage topology. It 
features a trim array to calibrate its input offset.

![Comparator Schematic](docs/pictures/comparator.png "Comparator architecture")


## Logic

The entire control logic is synthesized using the [openlane](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane) flow.
This allows to easily integrate the trim logic for the 
comparator into the overall control logic block.

For faster simulation the ngspice mixed-mode xspice feature was used.
[Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) can be used to synthesize a xspice 
compatible netlist that only uses code-model components (NAND, NOT, DFF etc.) 
which speeds up simulation substantially.

## DAC

The DAC is a capacitative DAC made from a total of 1024 unit caps
per side.

The unit size of the DAC elements is ~3fF based on FEM simulation carried out
with [Elmer FEM](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem).
You can find the full simulation setup in the elmer subfolder of this repo.

The process is:

- [klayout](https://www.klayout.de/) with [gds3xtrude](https://codeberg.org/tok/gds3xtrude) to get a stl mesh of the layout
- [freecad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) to convert mesh to step and encapsulate layout in boundary.
- [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) to create a .msh 3D mesh from the step file.
- ElmerMesh to convert the .msh file to Elmer compatible mesh.
- ElmerGUI to define boundary conditions for the problem.
- ElmerSolver to solve for the electric field, capacitance etc.
- [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) to verify the solution.

## Sampling Switch

The DAC is top-plate sampled using a bootstrapped switch.

![Sampling Switch](docs/pictures/bssw.png "Sampling Switch")


## Layout

The complete SAR-ADC layout can be seen below. It occupies an area of approximately
0.08745 mm² (530 μm x 165 μm).

![SAR layout](docs/pictures/sar_layout.png "SAR layout")


## Simulation

The result of a input voltage sweep across the full input range (-1.8V to 1.8V) can be seen below.

![SAR Simulation](docs/pictures/sar_simulation.png "SAR Simulation")

# Main

The main section contains various blocks that support the independent operation 
of the ADC.

![Architecture](docs/pictures/arch.png "Overall design architecture")


## Layout

The complete Main layout can be seen below. It occupies an area of approximately
0.1054 mm² ( 285 μm x 370 μm).

![Main Layout](docs/pictures/main_layout.png "Layout of the Main block")


# Simulation

All parts have been simulated, using [ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/), for PVT where relevant.

- TT, SS, SF, FF, FS + Cmax, Cmin + Rmax, Rmin
- Voltage +-10%
- Temperature range -20° to 85°

To carry out PVT simulations, I used my custom [ngsim](https://github.com/chrische-xx/ngsim) 
python package that allows to manipulate spice netlists between runs. 


## Block Simulation

A lot of different simulations were carried out on the individual blocks. 
The testbenches can be found in the xschem/tb folder under the respective
block name.

## Top-Level Simulation

A complete extracted top-level simulation was carried out using a modified
PDK and [Xyce](https://github.com/Xyce/Xyce).

An example from system startup to completion of the first SAR conversion cycle
with zero differential input voltage can be seen below.

![Top-Level Simulation](docs/pictures/top_sim.png "Top-Level Simulation")

It shows the output voltage of the positive and negative DAC side.
This simulation utilizes all internal blocks, such a bandgap, ldo and oscillator
to operate the ADC.
